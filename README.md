# Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) & RER Forecasting â€“ India vs USA

This project investigates the validity of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) between India (home country) and the USA (foreign country) and performs time series forecasting of the Real Exchange Rate (RER). The analysis is based on monthly data from January 2013 to December 2024 and provides insights into the behaviour of exchange rates in relation to inflation differentials.

### Objective
- Test **Absolute and Relative PPP** between India and the USA.
- Forecast **Real Exchange Rate (RER)** using time series models (ARIMA).
- Provide insights into macroeconomic indicators and exchange rate behaviour.

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Monthly data from 2013â€“2024 (Exchange Rates, Inflation Indices).
2. **PPP Testing**: Hypothesis testing for absolute and relative PPP.
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Stationarity checks, ACF/PACF analysis, model fitting.
4. **Forecasting**: Box-Jenkins ARIMA model for RER prediction.

### Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualisation
- ARIMA/Box-Jenkins methodology

### Key Takeaways
- Understanding the dynamics of inflation differentials and exchange rates.
- Real-world application of PPP theory in macroeconomics.
- Practical experience in time series forecasting and model evaluation.
